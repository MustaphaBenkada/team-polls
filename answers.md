# Team Polls Application - Technical Assessment Answers

## 1. Persistence Implementation
I implemented PostgreSQL as the primary database with the following features:
- Proper database migrations using `pg-migrate` stored in `/migrations` directory
- Connection pooling through `src/db.ts` for efficient concurrent connections
- Direct SQL queries instead of ORM for better control
- Schema design with separate tables for polls, votes, and user data
- Automatic migrations on container startup

## 2. Cache Implementation
Redis is implemented for two primary purposes:
- WebSocket fan-out: Efficiently broadcasting real-time poll updates to connected clients
- Rate limiting: Implementing 5 votes/sec per user using sliding window algorithm
- Redis connection is configured via environment variables for flexibility
- Separate Redis instances for development and production

## 3. Tests Implementation
Comprehensive testing suite using Jest:
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests with containerized test database
- WebSocket functionality tests
- API endpoint tests
- Maintains >80% code coverage
- Automated test runs in CI/CD pipeline

## 4. CI Implementation
GitHub Actions workflow includes:
- Automated dependency installation (`npm ci`)
- Full test suite execution
- Docker build verification
- Code quality checks
- Automated deployment pipeline
- Environment-specific configurations

## 5. Observability Implementation
Implemented monitoring and logging:
- Request logging middleware for API requests
- Detailed error tracking and logging
- Prometheus-format metrics at `/metrics` endpoint including:
  - Request latency metrics
  - Query performance metrics
  - Active WebSocket connections count
  - System resource utilization

## 6. Security Implementation
Comprehensive security measures:
- Helmet middleware for secure HTTP headers
- Environment-based secrets management
- CORS configuration with origin validation
- JWT-based authentication for protected endpoints
- Rate limiting implementation
- No sensitive information in repository
- Input validation and sanitization

## 7. Documentation
Detailed documentation provided in README.md:
- Architecture overview
- Setup instructions
- Docker-based run commands
- Scaling considerations
- Technology choice reasoning
- API documentation
- Development guidelines

## 8. Rate Limiting (F7)
Implemented rate limiting using Redis:
- 5 votes per second per user limit
- Sliding window algorithm for accurate tracking
- Burst request handling
- 429 status codes for limit exceeded
- Per-user limit tracking
- Configurable rate limit parameters

## 9. Poll Expiration (F8)
Automatic poll expiration system:
- Timestamp-based expiration stored in PostgreSQL
- Automatic expiration checking before vote acceptance
- Queryable final results after expiration
- WebSocket updates stop after expiration
- Cleanup of expired poll resources

## 10. Frontend Implementation
React/Vite frontend features:
- Real-time updates via WebSocket
- Clean, minimal UI design
- No refresh required for updates
- Responsive design for all devices
- TypeScript implementation
- Component-based architecture
- Error handling and loading states

## Technical Choices and Reasoning

### Backend
- **Node.js/Express**: Chosen for its excellent WebSocket support and async handling
- **TypeScript**: Provides type safety and better development experience
- **PostgreSQL**: Reliable, ACID-compliant database with good scaling options
- **Redis**: Perfect for real-time features and caching requirements

### Frontend
- **React**: Component-based UI with excellent state management
- **Vite**: Fast development experience and optimized builds
- **WebSocket**: Real-time updates without polling
- **TypeScript**: Type safety across the full stack

### Scaling Considerations
- Database connection pooling
- Redis caching layer
- WebSocket clustering support
- Docker containerization
- Horizontal scaling ready
- Load balancer compatible
